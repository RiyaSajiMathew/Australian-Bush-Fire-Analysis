# NSW Government Data Analysis Virtual Internship Program

## Project Description
<br>


This project involves a meticulous analysis of data from the NSW Public Service Commission's Workforce Profile, focusing on employment arrangements, age distribution, and diversity within the public sector. The insights gained will inform policy development and enhance the efficiency and inclusivity of the workforce.

Our task is to conduct an analysis focusing on part-time employees to brief our Director before their meeting with the Workforce Diversity Steering Committee. The analysis will cover the following aspects:

1. Analyzing trends in male and female employment over time, highlighting any significant changes.

2. Assessing the current representation of part-time employees in the entire sector and within each specific Cluster.

3. Calculating the proportion of male and female part-time employees relative to their respective workforce within the sector and each Cluster.

4. Examining changes in the above statistics over the past four years.

5. Projecting the representation of part-time employees by the year 2025 based on the current trends.

## Results 
<br>



The analysis highlights a rising trend in part-time positions complementing dominant full-time employment, signaling a growing demand for flexible work arrangements. 

Notably, female employees consistently outnumber their male counterparts in both full-time and part-time roles, emphasizing the significance of promoting gender equality. 

The Health sector emerges as a notable employer of part-time workers, while the Treasury sector demonstrates room for improvement in this regard. 

Projections indicate a slight decline in female full-time jobs and a significant decrease followed by a gradual increase in male full-time jobs. 

Strategic planning and gender-inclusive policies are pivotal to fostering a diverse and equitable workforce representation, ensuring optimal utilization of talent in various sectors.

## Future work
<br>

To gain more insights from the provided data on part-time employees in the NSW public sector workforce, several future works and analyses can be undertaken:

1. Long-term Trend Analysis: Conducting a more extensive historical analysis beyond the four years provided, examining data from previous decades, can reveal long-term patterns and help identify underlying factors driving changes in part-time employment.

2. Comparative Analysis with Other Regions: Comparing the part-time employment trends in the NSW public sector with other regions or countries can offer valuable benchmarks and identify potential best practices or areas for improvement.

3. Demographic Analysis: Analyzing the age distribution of part-time employees can provide insights into workforce planning and the potential impact of an aging workforce on part-time employment.

4. Geographic Analysis: Investigating part-time employment patterns based on geographic locations within NSW can help identify regional variations and guide targeted policies for specific areas.

5. Reasons for Part-Time Employment: Conducting surveys or qualitative research to understand the reasons employees opt for part-time work can shed light on work-life balance, job satisfaction, and employee preferences.

By pursuing these future works, policymakers and organizations can unlock deeper insights into the dynamics of part-time employment in the NSW public sector. These insights will aid in crafting targeted and effective strategies to foster a diverse, inclusive, and adaptable workforce, ultimately enhancing the overall performance and resilience of the public sector.
